# ConsumerProducerModel
This is a model that tracks the consumption and production of works of fiction and non-fiction over multiple iterations.

Currently tracked variables are:
- Consumer costs and gains
- Producer costs and gains
- Saturation
- Balanced gain
- Mutations
- Influence
- Purchase count

The code should be fairly easy to modify. Currently it produces a 100 by 100 matrix of the final probabilities of productions after 100 generations (determined to be a point of equilibrium, running the code 1000 more iterations should not change the outcome).
